# Django-TestCases
A practice repo where I explore django tests, factory boy, mock calls, django signals and docker. The use case was from an interview where I failed so this is me learning from my mistakes
# Use Case
The use case is a fintech startup that trades digital currency between users of the system. The Transfer ledger always records two transactions per action. A debit on the receivers account(positive amount) and a credit on the senders account(negative amount)
# Practice points
1. Django Tests using factory boy
2. Using Github issues and PRs
3. Django Signals
