# Django-TestCases
A practice repo where I explore django tests, factory boy, mock calls, django signals and docker. The use case was from an interview where I failed so this is me learning from my mistakes

# Practice points
1. Django Tests using factory boy
2. Using Github issues and PRs
3. Django Signals
